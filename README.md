# BotterLord
My personal side project that was inspired by *TIS-100, EmpireMud and Overlord Novels by Kugane Maruyama.* 

The plan is to create a DOS inspired retro castle management/strategy game where you personally will be responsible for the Npc's AIs,
and hopefully a lot more.

Mind that the screenshot is from the **old version**, in the new concept there won't be a map but instead of a realtime visual of the castle.

The reasons for purging the map idea was because it wasn't really going along with the main mechanic of the game which is micromanagement, while also taking a lot of time and effort to make it work like it should. And thus I decided that it would be better to make a great game with less fancy mechanics than a game with tons of barely working mechanics.
